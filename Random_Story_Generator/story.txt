Once upon a time there was a _animal.  The _0 lived in a very scary _place.
One day, the _0 left his _2 and went in search of a _food.  
The _0 wandered for _time and finally reached a _place.
In that _8 the _0 encountered a _magiccreature with a _thing.
_greeting! _said the _11.  What brings you to my _8, the _11 asked
waving his _12 towards the _0.
I left my _2 in search of a _5 because I was hungry and my _2 is
quite a scary place.  Do you have any _5 here the _0 _said?
Why it just so happens that I do have one the _11 _14.  However,
I will only share it with you if you help me fix my _12, which
is not quite working right at the moment.   Oh _12 repair _said
the _0?  Why that is my area of expertise.  Let me take a look
at your _12.  The _11 handed his _12 to the _0, who promptly
fixed it, and was rewarded with a _5.   The _0 and _11 became
best friends and lived happily ever after in the _8.

The end.
